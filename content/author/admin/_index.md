### Short bio 

I take pleasure in developing computational methods to answer scientific questions and to make the world more enjoyable.
I have obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch) with a focus on Machine Learning and got excited about using it for analyzing large microscopy image datasets. 

Currently, I am developing and carrying out the computational efforts to automate cell organelle segmentation in electron microscopy data in [Tom Kirchhausen's lab](https://kirchhausen.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School. Among other intriguing things, Tom's lab uses various state-of-the-art microscopy imaging techniques 
<!--such as [lattice light-sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_light-sheet_microscopy) and [serial block-face scanning electron microscopy](https://www.embl.de/services/core_facilities/em/services/fibsem/),-->
to examine subcellular and molecular structures in order to advance the understanding of many diseases such as cancer and viral infections. 

Before starting my current position, I spent time at the [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/) for writing my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/benjamin9555/project_summaries/blob/master/msc_thesis_learning_to_agglomerate_in_region_adjacency_graphs.pdf). I worked on 3D Neuron Reconstruction from electron microscopy images with [Jan Funke](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab/), whose group mainly develops Computer Vision and Machine Learning methods for analyzing microscopy images of brains.
